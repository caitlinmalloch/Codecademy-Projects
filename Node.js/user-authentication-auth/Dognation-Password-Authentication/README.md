# Dognation: Password Authentication

This project is part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Program, as part of the back-end development curriculum.

The application is a website for dogwalkers to share pictures with friends. The app was originally missing configuration to authenticate users.

## Changes made to orginal files:

- use express-sessions
- use passport.js with passport-local
- use bcrypt.js
- authenticate users for registration, login, viewing access, logout
