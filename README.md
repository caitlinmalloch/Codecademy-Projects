# Codecademy-Projects

This repository will hold all of my complete and in-progress code projects. To see my practice code challenges 
and other functions I have learned in the program, check out this repository: 

https://github.com/caitlinmalloch/Codecademy-Full-Stack-Dev_Code-Practice

The projects completed in this repository are part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Program. I used Visual Studio Code to 
complete these projects on my personal PC and then used source control in VSC to make commits to GitHub. 

I have created projects using: HTML, CSS, JS, React

I'm a self-taught programmer and I'm always looking for new things to learn. If you have any comments on my code or projects, 
feel free to reach out!

Cheers, 
Cait
